#OpenCV is an open-source machine learning library and provides a common infrastructure for computer vision. Whereas Pytesseract is a Tesseract-OCR Engine to read image types and extract the information present in the image.

1.Gaussian Blur: Here we use a Gaussian kernel to smoothen the image. This technique is highly effective to remove Gaussian noise. OpenCV provides a cv2.GaussianBlur() function for this task.

2.Sobel: Here we calculate the derivatives from the image. This feature is important for many computer vision tasks. Using derivatives we calculate the gradients, and a high change in gradient indicates a major change in the image. OpenCV provides a cv2.Sobel() function to calculate Sobel operators.

3.Morphological Transformation: These are the operations based on image shapes and are performed on binary images. The basic morphological operations are Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing. The different functions provided in OpenCV are:
cv2.erode()
cv2.dilate()
cv2.morphologyEx()

4.Contours: Contours are the curves containing all the continuous points of same intensity. These are very useful tools for object recognition. OpenCV provides cv2.findContours() functions for this feature.
